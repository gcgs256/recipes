Mix together the ground beef, matzo meal, egg yolks, and garlic and onion powder, then make into 1 inch meatballs

Saute meatballs until brown on all sides; you might have to do this in two batches.

Combine the chili sauce and cranberry sauce (or grape jelly) in a large pot, and add about 16-18 oz of water. Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer. Add in meatballs.

Cover and cook for 40 min.
