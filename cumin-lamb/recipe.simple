<NOTES>
Can substitute peanut oil for chili oil to make less spicy.

Can substitute beef for lamb if desired. Go with sirloin, skirt, or flank.

Not sure what best cut of lamb to use is, but lamb shoulder chops have worked fine in the past.

If you don't have chili oil but want to make it spicy, use regular oil and toss the meat with about a tbsp of sichuan chili flakes.

If using very fresh/high quality peppercorn, decrease amount by half.
</NOTES>
