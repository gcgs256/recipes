<DESCRIPTION>
Common dessert found in Thai restaurants. Typically requires overnight soaking of rice and
steaming. With the instant pot we can skip soaking and have it ready in less than half an
hour.

<NOTES>
Serve with Mango or thai custard.

Here's a quick simple recipe for Thai custard: beat 1 egg, 1/3c coconut milk, 2 tbsp light brown sugar together in a small bowl.
steam with 1c water in instant pot for ~12min.

The pot-in-pot equipment used to write this recipe consisted of a pyrex glass bowl with
a 6" inner diameter and the screw-on lid from a masen jar as a trivet.

I've had success halving the recipe by halving all the sauce components, the rice, and
using 3 tbsp (slightly more than half) of the water in the steaming bowl. I
reduced the high pressure time to 12 min.
