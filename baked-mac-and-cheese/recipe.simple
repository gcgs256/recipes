<STEPS>
Preheat oven to 375F, butter a 3-quart cassarole dish.

Warm milk over medium heat. In a separate large stock pot, melt butter until bubbling, then add flour and cook, stirring for 1 min. Add warm milk to stock pot slowly. Whisk mixture constantly until it thickens and starts to bubble.

Remove pot from heat, add 300g (~3 cup) cheddar, 170g (~1.5 cup) gruyere, nutmeg, black pepper, red pepper, salt and whisk until smooth.

Cook macaroni a little less than al-dente - it should be a bit undercooked. Mix together with cheese sauce and pour mixture into casserole.

Sprinkle remaining cheese and optional topping over casserole. Bake for ~30min.
