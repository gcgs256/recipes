<DESCRIPTION>
Classic chocolate fondue for dipping your favorite treats in.
</DESCRIPTION>
<NOTES>
Use your favorite chocolate. I've had good results mixing 50/50 milk and dark.

This recipe makes enough for a small dessert for two. If you'd like a larger desert for two, 1.5-2x it.

Some ideas for dippables: brioche bread, challah bread, bannanas, strawberries, marshmallows.

I've had good results stirring in a spoonful of dulce de leche at the end.

If you serve straight out of the pot it should stay warm enough for the duration of a typical dessert.
