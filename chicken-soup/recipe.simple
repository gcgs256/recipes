</NOTES>
<STEPS>
Chop all vegetables into similar size pieces.

Put all ingredients into a large pot and add water until almost full (make sure chicken is fully submerged so it cooks).

Bring pot to a boil, then lower to a simmer, cover, and cook for 40 min.

Drain out chicken and vegetables (make sure if using a colander to place a pot underneath so you don't lose the soup!). You can use the chicken in various other recipes, like Holiday chicken. You can also leave the vegetables in if you prefer.
