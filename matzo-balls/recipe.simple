</NOTES>
<STEPS>
Lightly beat the eggs.

Add remaining ingredients, mix together lightly.

Refrigerate for at least one hour.

Bring soup to a boil, then lower to simmer. Drop in 1 inch matzo balls - it's important not to make them too big (they will expand) and don't try to make them perfect or mush them a lot or they will be hard.

Cover and cook 20 min.
