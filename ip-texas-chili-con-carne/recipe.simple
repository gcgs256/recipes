</INGREDIENTS>
<STEPS>
Add dried chilies (not chipotle) to large dutch oven or stock pot, cook dry over medium-high heat
stirring frequently until slightly darkened with intense roasted aroma. 2-5 min. Don't allow to
smoke. Alternatively you can instead microwave the chilies in 15-sec increments until pliable and
toasted-smelling.

Combine roasted chilies with chicken stock and chipotles in 2 qt microwave safe bowl or cup. Cover
with plastic wrap and microwave on high power until gently simmering, about 5 min. Set aside.

Season chuck steaks with salt & pepper. Heat oil over high heat in instant pot until smoking. Add
HALF of the chuck steak to the cooker in a single layer without moving until deeply browned, about 6
min. Flip and brown the second side for a few more mins. Transfer to cutting board.

Add onions to instant pot, stirring frequently until translucent and soft about 2 min.

Add garlic, cinnamon, cumin, allspice, oregano to instant pot and stir until fragrant, about 1 min.

Add chicken stock mixture to instant pot and bring to simmer.

Transfer contents to instant pot to blender and puree until smooth (careful not to overfill).
Transfer puree back to instant pot.

Cut both the raw and browned chuck steaks until 1.5-2 inch chunks and add to instant pot.

Cook on high pressure for 30 min. Then quick release.

Stir in fish sauce, masa harina, and vinegar. Simmer until desired thickness, about 5 mins. Season
to taste with salt and more fish sauce.

Serve garnished with cilantro, chopped onions, scallions, grated cheese, avocado, and warm tortillas
as desired.
