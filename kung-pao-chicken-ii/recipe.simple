<NOTES>
Don't forget to serve with rice.

I tend to use a large cast iron skillet instead of a wok since it tends to work
better with low power stoves.
</NOTES>
<STEPS>
Marinate chicken for at least 15min.

Add 2 tbsp oil to wok over high heat. When hot but not yet smoking add chiles and sichuan pepper and stir-fry briefly until fragrant.

Add chicken, stir-frying constantly until barely cooked.

Add the ginger/garlic/scallions, stir-fry until tender and fragrant.

Give the sauce a quick stir and the pour it over the wok, stir-frying and tossing until sauce is thick and shiny.

Stir in peanuts and serve.
